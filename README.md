This FastAPI-based Python web application allows users to search for Wikipedia articles based on keywords, save favorite articles, and auto-tag them with relevant categories using Gemini Pro. The app provides user authentication, displays saved articles along with AI-generated tags, and allows users to modify tags. Deployed on Netlify with CockroachDB, this app also leverages Langchain to process LLM tasks.
